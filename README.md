# Hangman Game - Kotlin

This project is an ongoing development of a hangman game implemented in Kotlin. 
The game is based on guessing a word letter by letter. 
With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. 
The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses, and when they run out, the game ends.
